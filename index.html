        These scripts are necessary for Bootstrap's interactive components (e.g., navbars, carousels).
        While not strictly required for this simple page, it's good practice to include them when
        using Bootstrap to ensure all functionality is available if the page were to expand.
        Popper.js is a dependency for many Bootstrap components like tooltips and popovers.
